# Understanding the interaction between human activities and physical health under extreme heat environment in Phoenix, Arizona

# Introduction
This github repo deposits the web-based interactive visualization videos to demontrate the research results from ActivityLog-HeatMappers Citizen Science Program by the ASU Knowledge Exchange for Resilience research team. We also include a few jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how we generate the figures in the manuscript.
